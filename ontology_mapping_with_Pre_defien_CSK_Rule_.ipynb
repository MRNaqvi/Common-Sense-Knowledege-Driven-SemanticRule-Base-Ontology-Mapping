            "3. Formal Definition – A statement or expression made using a formal language. A Formal Language can be considered as composed of symbols (aka the alphabet, aka signature), logical symbols (for conjunction, disjunction, implication, equivalence, and quantification), non-logical symbols, and a a set of rules for creating (well formed) statements/expressions in the language. In the case of OWL there are non-logical symbols for classes, object properties, and data properties and these non-logical symbols are usually natural language terms or phrases.\n",

            " b) For classes, the only Formal statements or expressions in an IOF ontology are the First Order Logic Definition annotation and the OWL or Common Logic (class or relation) axioms. Note, in the case of a primitive or axiomatic notion there will be no (complete) necessary and sufficient formal definition or axioms.\n",
            " c) One point to bear in mind in the way the IOF is using formal languages is that the majority of the symbols used are not from the Greek alphabet nor single characters (usually) but are derived from natural language terms or phrases. This distinction must be kept in mind.\n",
