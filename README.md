## Overview

Thissystem leverages the Owlready2 library to manage and manipulate ontologies for semantic rule application. It's designed to support researchers and developers in fields like knowledge engineering, providing tools for ontology loading, updating, rule application, and exporting.

## Key Features

- **Load Ontologies**: Load RDF/OWL ontologies for manipulation.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Add new classes and instances to existing ontologies.
- **Semantic Rule Application**: Apply common sense knowledge rules to enhance ontology.
- **Export Ontologies**: Save updated ontologies back to RDF/XML format.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Owlready2
- Pandas

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install owlready2 pandas

##Installation
